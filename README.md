##### Code Prerequisites
Install python 3.6.

##### Set up python environment:
(1) Run `$ ./bootstrap.sh`.\
(2) Start the virtual environment with `$ source activate`.\
You should now be ready to run your code.\
(3) Run `$ deactivate` when you are done.

##### Run the python code:
After you've started the virtual environment with `$ source activate`, you can run your python code (e.g. `$ python helloworld.py`).

##### Troubleshooting:
- If you are given a permissions error when trying to run `$ ./bootstrap.sh` (e.g. `-bash: ./bootstrap.sh: Permission denied`), then run this command to add executable permissions: `$ chmod a+x bootstrap.sh`.
